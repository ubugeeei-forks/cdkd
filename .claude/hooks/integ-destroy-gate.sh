# Decide whether the diff actually touches deletion logic. The markgate
# scope (.markgate.yml) is file-level, so it can't tell apart a real
# delete-method change from an unrelated edit in the same file (e.g.
# adding `provider.import` to every provider in PR #67 invalidated the
# marker even though no provider's `delete` was modified). Use git diff
# vs origin/main to look at the actual hunks: if no delete-touching
# symbol is added or removed, skip the gate entirely.
#
# Heuristic:
# - "strict-delete" files (dag-builder.ts, implicit-delete-deps.ts,
#   lambda-vpc-deps.ts): any change at all is delete-touching. These
#   are small high-stakes analyzer files where a typical addition is an
#   array entry like `'AWS::Foo': ['AWS::Bar']` whose text does NOT
#   contain the delete-symbol vocabulary, so the hunk filter would
#   miss it. Keep strict.
# - "filtered-delete" files (destroy.ts, destroy-runner.ts,
#   deploy-engine.ts): considered delete-touching ONLY when the diff
#   hunks add/remove a delete-related symbol — same filter as provider
#   files. These are larger files that mix delete logic with UX
#   strings, command wiring, log messages, etc. Pure UX-string edits
#   here have no behavioral effect on the destroy path (e.g. PR #84
#   fixed a `--region` → `--stack-region` error message in destroy.ts);
#   the old strict rule made such trivial PRs un-mergeable until
#   /run-integ was re-run, even though no destroy code changed.
# - provider files: only delete-touching when the diff hunks add/remove
#   a delete-related symbol (delete*, IMPLICIT_DELETE, ENI/hyperplane,
#   DependencyViolation).
# - everything else: not delete-touching.
#
# When in doubt, fall through to verifying the marker — false positives
# cost an integ-test run; false negatives cost a broken main.

Required action — no exceptions:

The skill is the ONLY legitimate setter of this marker. It will run
deploy + destroy against real AWS and only call
`markgate set integ-destroy` if BOTH of the following hold:
  - destroy completed with 0 errors
  - 0 orphan resources after the post-destroy verification

Do NOT call `markgate set integ-destroy` directly from a shell to
bypass this hook. The whole point of the gate is that an unverified
destroy cannot reach main; setting the marker by hand defeats it. If
you believe the file in scope is genuinely unrelated to deletion
behavior, the right fix is to narrow `.markgate.yml` integ-destroy
scope, not to bypass the marker.
