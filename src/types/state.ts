 * - 2 — region-prefixed layout: `s3://{bucket}/cdkd/{stackName}/{region}/state.json`.
 * - 3 — adds `ResourceState.observedProperties` (AWS-current snapshot
 *       captured at deploy/import time, used as the drift comparator's
 *       baseline). Layout is the same as v2; only the resource-level shape
 *       grew. v2 readers see v3 as `version: 3` and fail clearly.
 *
 * cdkd readers handle every prior version. Writers always emit
 * `STATE_SCHEMA_VERSION_CURRENT`. An older cdkd binary that only knows an
 * earlier version will fail with a clear error when it encounters a higher
 * version, rather than silently mishandling the new format.
