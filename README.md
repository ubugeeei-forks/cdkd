# cdkd

**cdkd** (CDK Direct) - A from-scratch CDK CLI with its own deployment engine — provisions via AWS SDK instead of CloudFormation.

- **Direct provisioning** via AWS SDK instead of CloudFormation
- **From-scratch CDK CLI** - synthesis orchestration, asset publishing, context resolution (no aws-cdk / toolkit-lib dependency)
- **CDK compatible** - use your existing CDK app code as-is
- **Own deployment engine** - diff calculation, dependency graph, parallel execution, state management (what CloudFormation handles internally)

> **⚠️ WARNING: NOT PRODUCTION READY**
>
> This project is in early development and is **NOT suitable for production use**. Features are incomplete, APIs may change without notice, and there may be bugs that could affect your AWS infrastructure. Use at your own risk in development/testing environments only.

> **Note**: This is an experimental/educational project exploring alternative deployment approaches for AWS CDK. It is **not intended to replace** the official AWS CDK CLI, but rather to experiment with direct SDK provisioning as a learning exercise and proof of concept.

## Features

- **Synthesis orchestration**: CDK app subprocess execution, Cloud Assembly parsing, context provider loop
- **Asset handling**: Self-implemented asset publisher for S3 file assets (ZIP packaging) and Docker images (ECR)
- **Context resolution**: Self-implemented context provider loop for Vpc.fromLookup(), AZ, SSM, HostedZone, etc.
- **Hybrid provisioning**: SDK Providers for fast direct API calls, Cloud Control API fallback for broad resource coverage
- **Diff calculation**: Self-implemented resource/property-level diff between desired template and current state
- **S3-based state management**: No DynamoDB required, uses S3 conditional writes for locking
- **DAG-based parallelization**: Analyze `Ref`/`Fn::GetAtt` dependencies and execute in parallel
- **Rollback on failure**: When a deploy errors mid-stack, cdkd rolls back the resources it just created so the stack state stays consistent (CloudFormation parity — but cdkd does this without round-tripping through CFn). Pass `cdkd deploy --no-rollback` to skip rollback and keep the partial state for Terraform-style inspection / repair. See [Rollback behavior](#rollback-behavior).
- **`--no-wait` for async resources**: Skip the multi-minute wait on CloudFront / RDS / ElastiCache / NAT Gateway and return as soon as the create call returns (CloudFormation always blocks)
- **VPC route DependsOn relaxation (on by default)**: Drop CDK-injected defensive `DependsOn` edges from VPC Lambdas onto private-subnet routes so `CloudFront::Distribution` and `Lambda::Url` start their ~3-min propagation in parallel with NAT Gateway stabilization (~50% faster on VPC + Lambda + CloudFront stacks). Pass `--no-aggressive-vpc-parallel` to opt out.

> **Note**: Resource types not covered by either SDK Providers or Cloud Control API cannot be deployed with cdkd. If you encounter an unsupported resource type, deployment will fail with a clear error message.

## Benchmark

**cdkd deploys up to ~5x faster than AWS CDK (CloudFormation).**

Measured on `us-east-1` with 5 independent resources per stack (fully parallelized by cdkd's DAG scheduler).

### SDK Provider path — **4.8x faster** (20.5s vs 98.4s)

Stack: S3 Bucket, DynamoDB Table, SQS Queue, SNS Topic, SSM Parameter.

| Phase | cdkd | AWS CDK (CFn) | Speedup |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Synthesis | 3.5s | 4.1s | 1.2x |
| Deploy | 17.0s | 94.4s | **5.5x** |
| **Total** | **20.5s** | **98.4s** | **4.8x** |

### Cloud Control API fallback path — **1.5x faster** (44.6s vs 69.1s)

Stack: SSM Document × 3 + Athena WorkGroup × 2 (no SDK provider — CC API fallback).

| Phase | cdkd | AWS CDK (CFn) | Speedup |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Synthesis | 3.7s | 4.2s | 1.1x |
| Deploy | 40.9s | 64.9s | **1.6x** |
| **Total** | **44.6s** | **69.1s** | **1.5x** |

### Resource Provisioning

cdkd ships **90+ dedicated SDK Providers** (direct AWS SDK calls, no
polling overhead) covering the most-used services — IAM, Lambda, S3,
DynamoDB, EC2, RDS, ECS, API Gateway, CloudFront, Step Functions, EFS,
KMS, Cognito, AppSync, and more. **Any other CloudFormation resource
type** is handled via the Cloud Control API fallback (async polling).
Resource types not supported by either path fail at deploy time with a
clear error.

See **[docs/supported-resources.md](docs/supported-resources.md)** for
the full per-type table.

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js** >= 20.0.0
- **AWS CDK Bootstrap**: You must run `cdk bootstrap` before using cdkd. cdkd uses CDK's bootstrap bucket (`cdk-hnb659fds-assets-*`) for asset uploads (Lambda code, Docker images). Custom bootstrap qualifiers are supported — CDK embeds the correct bucket/repo names in the asset manifest during synthesis.
- **AWS Credentials**: Configured via environment variables, `~/.aws/credentials`, `--profile`, or `--role-arn` option. **The credentials must have admin-equivalent permissions for the resources being deployed.** Unlike `cdk deploy`, cdkd does NOT route through CloudFormation, so there is no cfn-exec-role to delegate to — every IAM / EC2 / Lambda / etc. API call is issued from cdkd directly. CDK CLI's `cdk-hnb659fds-deploy-role-*` only carries CFn + asset-publish permissions and is therefore NOT sufficient for cdkd. See `--role-arn` in [docs/cli-reference.md](docs/cli-reference.md) for assuming a role with the right permissions.

## Installation

```bash
npm i -g @go-to-k/cdkd          # latest release
npm i -g @go-to-k/cdkd@0.0.2    # pin to a specific version
```

The installed binary is `cdkd`.

> cdkd is an experimental / educational project and is not intended for production use — see the warning at the top of this README. Pin to a specific version if you need reproducible installs.

## Quick Start

> **First-time setup**: cdkd requires a one-time `cdkd bootstrap` per AWS
> account before any other command will work — it creates the S3 state
> bucket (`cdkd-state-{accountId}`) that cdkd uses to track deployed
> resources. This is separate from `cdk bootstrap` (which sets up the
> CDK asset bucket / ECR repo and is also required — see
> [Prerequisites](#prerequisites)).

```bash
# Bootstrap (creates S3 state bucket — one-time setup, once per AWS account)
cdkd bootstrap

# List stacks in the CDK app
cdkd list

# Deploy your CDK app
cdkd deploy

# Check what would change
cdkd diff

# Tear down
cdkd destroy
```

That's it. cdkd reads `--app` from `cdk.json` and auto-resolves the state bucket from your AWS account ID (`cdkd-state-{accountId}`). If you bootstrapped under a previous cdkd version, the legacy region-suffixed name (`cdkd-state-{accountId}-{region}`) is still picked up automatically with a deprecation warning.

## Usage

cdkd has three command families:

- **Top-level commands** (`cdkd deploy` / `destroy` / `diff` / `synth` /
  `list` / `import` / `orphan` / `publish-assets`) require a CDK app —
  they synthesize a template to learn what they're operating on.
- **`cdkd state ...` subcommands** (`state info` / `list` / `resources`
  / `show` / `orphan` / `destroy` / `migrate` / `refresh-observed`)
  operate on the S3 state bucket only and do NOT need the CDK app —
  use them to inspect / clean up state when the source is gone or
  you don't want to synth. `cdkd state destroy` is the CDK-app-free
  counterpart of `cdkd destroy`.
- **`cdkd local ...` subcommands** (`local invoke`, `local start-api`)
  run synthesized Lambda functions locally inside Docker containers that
  bundle the AWS Lambda Runtime Interface Emulator (RIE). `local invoke`
  runs a single Lambda once; `local start-api` stands up a long-running
  HTTP server that maps API Gateway / HTTP API / Function URL routes to
  local Lambda invocations. No AWS API calls, no state bucket needed.

Options like `--app`, `--state-bucket`, and `--context` can be omitted if configured via `cdk.json` or environment variables (`CDKD_APP`, `CDKD_STATE_BUCKET`).

```bash
# Bootstrap (create S3 bucket for state)
cdkd bootstrap \
  --state-bucket my-cdkd-state \
  --region us-east-1

# Synthesize only
cdkd synth --app "npx ts-node app.ts"

# List all stacks in the CDK app (alias: ls)
cdkd list
cdkd ls
cdkd list --long              # YAML records with id/name/environment
cdkd list --long --json       # same, but JSON
cdkd list --show-dependencies # id + dependency list per stack
cdkd list 'MyStage/*'         # filter by display path (CDK CLI parity)

# Deploy from a pre-synthesized cloud assembly directory
cdkd deploy --app cdk.out

# Deploy (single stack auto-detected, reads --app from cdk.json)
cdkd deploy

# Deploy specific stack(s)
cdkd deploy MyStack
cdkd deploy Stack1 Stack2

# Deploy all stacks
cdkd deploy --all

# Deploy with wildcard (matched against the physical CloudFormation stack name)
cdkd deploy 'My*'

# Deploy stacks under a CDK Stage using the hierarchical path (CDK CLI parity)
# Patterns containing '/' are routed to the CDK display path; both forms work:
cdkd deploy 'MyStage/*'        # all stacks under MyStage
cdkd deploy MyStage/Api        # specific stack by display path
cdkd deploy MyStage-Api        # same stack by physical CloudFormation name

# Deploy with context values
cdkd deploy -c env=staging -c featureFlag=true

# Deploy with explicit options
cdkd deploy MyStack \
  --app "npx ts-node app.ts" \
  --state-bucket my-cdkd-state \
  --verbose

# Show diff (what would change)
cdkd diff MyStack

# Detect drift between cdkd state and AWS reality (state-only; no synth)
# Exits 0 with no drift, 1 when drift is detected, 2 on partial revert failure.
cdkd drift MyStack
cdkd drift --all --json

# Resolve drift: state ← AWS (catch up state with manual console changes)
cdkd drift MyStack --accept --yes

# Resolve drift: AWS ← state (push state values back into AWS via provider.update)
cdkd drift MyStack --revert --yes

# Refresh the deploy-time AWS snapshot used as drift baseline.
# Optional — `cdkd deploy` itself auto-refreshes on the first deploy after
# upgrading from a pre-v3 cdkd binary (= state schema `version: 2`), in
# parallel with the deploy at no critical-path cost. This command is the
# manual / non-deploy path: run it when you want the baseline refreshed
# without redeploying (e.g. for resources that won't change in any
# near-future deploy). Idempotent on the same v3 state — see "Drift
# detection" below for the full upgrade story.
cdkd state refresh-observed MyStack

# Dry run (plan only, no changes)
cdkd deploy --dry-run

# Deploy with no rollback on failure (Terraform-style)
cdkd deploy --no-rollback

# Deploy only the specified stack (skip dependency auto-inclusion)
cdkd deploy -e MyStack

# Skip the multi-minute wait on async resources (CloudFront, RDS, NAT GW, etc.)
cdkd deploy --no-wait

# Synth + build + publish assets only (no deploy) — typical CI split
cdkd publish-assets

# Destroy resources
cdkd destroy MyStack
cdkd destroy --all --force

# Force-unlock a stale lock from interrupted deploy
cdkd force-unlock MyStack

# Adopt already-deployed AWS resources into cdkd state.
# See docs/import.md for the full guide (auto / selective / hybrid modes,
# --resource overrides, --resource-mapping CDK CLI compatibility).
cdkd import MyStack --dry-run
cdkd import MyStack --yes

# Inspect state-bucket info on demand (bucket name, region, source, schema version, stack count).
# Routine commands (deploy / destroy / etc.) no longer print the bucket banner by default —
# pass --verbose to surface it in their debug logs, or use this subcommand for an explicit answer.
cdkd state info
cdkd state info --json        # JSON output for tooling
cdkd state info --state-bucket my-bucket  # explicit bucket; reports Source: --state-bucket flag

# List stacks registered in the cdkd state bucket
cdkd state list
cdkd state ls --long          # include resource count, last-modified, lock status
cdkd state list --json        # JSON output (alone, or combined with --long)

# List resources of a single stack from state
cdkd state resources MyStack          # aligned columns: LogicalID, Type, PhysicalID
cdkd state resources MyStack --long   # per-resource block with dependencies and attributes
cdkd state resources MyStack --json   # full JSON array

# Show full state record for a stack (metadata, outputs, all resources incl. properties)
cdkd state show MyStack
cdkd state show MyStack --json        # raw {state, lock} JSON

# Orphan one or more RESOURCES from cdkd's state (does NOT delete AWS resources).
# Per-resource, mirrors aws-cdk-cli's `cdk orphan --unstable=orphan`.
# Synth-driven — needs --app / cdk.json. Construct paths use CDK's L2-style form
# (`<StackName>/<Path/To/Construct>`); the synthesized `/Resource` suffix is
# matched implicitly. Passing an L2 wrapper that contains multiple CFn resources
# orphans every child under it (matches upstream's prefix-match semantics).
cdkd orphan MyStack/MyTable                    # confirmation prompt (y/N)
cdkd orphan MyStack/MyTable --yes
cdkd orphan MyStack/MyTable MyStack/MyBucket   # multiple resources, same stack
cdkd orphan MyStack/MyTable --dry-run          # print rewrite audit, no save
cdkd orphan MyStack/MyTable --force            # also fall back to cached
                                               # attributes when live fetch fails

# State-driven counterpart that orphans a WHOLE STACK's state record
# (no CDK app needed — works against the bucket).
cdkd state orphan MyStack             # confirmation prompt (y/N)
cdkd state orphan MyStack --yes       # skip confirmation
cdkd state orphan StackA StackB --force # also bypass the locked-stack refusal

# Destroy a stack's AWS resources AND remove its state record, without
# requiring the CDK app (no synth — works from any working directory).
cdkd state destroy MyStack            # per-stack confirmation prompt
cdkd state destroy MyStack OtherStack --yes
cdkd state destroy --all -y           # every stack in the bucket
cdkd state destroy MyStack --region us-east-1
```

## Rollback behavior

When a deploy fails mid-stack (e.g. a resource hits a validation error
or AWS rejects the request), cdkd by default **rolls back the
already-completed resources in the same deploy** so the stack state
stays consistent — every resource cdkd just created in this run is
deleted in reverse dependency order, the state record is updated to
match, and the CLI exits non-zero. Resources that existed before this
deploy are NOT touched.

Pass `cdkd deploy --no-rollback` to skip the rollback (Terraform-style:
the partial state is preserved so you can `cdkd state show <stack>`,
inspect what landed, fix the underlying issue, and re-run `cdkd deploy`
to continue from the half-deployed state). Recommended only when you
plan to manually inspect / repair; the default is safer for CI.

Mid-deploy state is also saved per-resource as work completes, so even
if cdkd itself crashes between the failure and the rollback, the state
file accurately reflects what's on AWS and a follow-up `cdkd destroy`
won't orphan anything.

## `--no-wait`: skip async-resource waits

CloudFront / RDS / ElastiCache / NAT Gateway typically take 1–15
minutes to fully provision. By default cdkd waits (matching CFn).
`cdkd deploy --no-wait` returns as soon as the create call returns
and lets AWS finish in the background — handy for CI where nothing
in the deploy flow needs the resource fully active. **Deploy-only**:
`cdkd destroy` always waits (NAT in `deleting` state holds ENIs and
would `DependencyViolation` sibling deletes).

See [docs/cli-reference.md](docs/cli-reference.md#--no-wait-skip-async-resource-waits)
for per-resource caveats (NAT egress, RDS final-snapshot timing,
etc.).

## VPC route DependsOn relaxation (on by default)

CDK injects defensive `DependsOn` from VPC Lambdas onto private-subnet
routes. The dependency is real at runtime but NOT required at deploy
time. cdkd drops it by default so CloudFront + Lambda::Url propagation
runs in parallel with NAT stabilization (~50% faster on VPC+Lambda+CloudFront
stacks; bench-cdk-sample 398s → 181s). Pass
`cdkd deploy --no-aggressive-vpc-parallel` to opt out (e.g. when a
Custom Resource synchronously invokes a VPC Lambda outside cdkd's
Lambda-ServiceToken Active wait).

See [docs/cli-reference.md](docs/cli-reference.md) for the full
type-pair allowlist and trade-off notes.

## Importing existing resources

`cdkd import` adopts AWS resources that are already deployed (via
`cdk deploy`, manual creation, or another tool) into cdkd state so the
next `cdkd deploy` updates them in-place instead of CREATEing duplicates.

```bash
# Adopt a whole stack previously deployed by cdk deploy (tag-based auto-lookup).
cdkd import MyStack --yes

# Adopt only specific resources (CDK CLI parity).
cdkd import MyStack --resource MyBucket=my-bucket-name

# Migrate off CloudFormation in one shot — adopt + retire the source CFn stack.
cdkd import MyStack --migrate-from-cloudformation --yes
```

See **[docs/import.md](docs/import.md)** for the full guide: three import
modes (auto / selective / hybrid), `--resource-mapping` CDK CLI
compatibility, CloudFormation migration flow, provider coverage, and the
parity matrix vs upstream `cdk import`.

## Drift detection

`cdkd drift` (state-driven; no synth) compares each managed resource
against AWS reality and reports divergence — including console-side
changes to keys you did NOT template (S3 public-access-block, IAM Role
tags, Lambda env keys, etc.).

```bash
cdkd drift                       # auto-detect single stack, exit 1 if drift
cdkd drift MyStack --json        # machine-readable, for CI gating
cdkd drift MyStack --accept --yes   # state ← AWS (catch up after a console edit)
cdkd drift MyStack --revert --yes   # AWS ← state (undo a console edit)
cdkd state refresh-observed MyStack # populate the drift baseline without redeploying
```

See **[docs/cli-reference.md `cdkd drift`](docs/cli-reference.md#cdkd-drift)**
for the full reference: `--no-capture-observed-state` deploy opt-out
(per-command vs per-project, mid-flight reversibility), v2→v3 state
upgrade flow, exit codes, and what changes when capture is off.

## Orphan vs destroy

`destroy` deletes the AWS resources **and** the state record;
`orphan` deletes **only** the state record (AWS resources stay
intact, just no longer tracked by cdkd). Mirrors aws-cdk-cli's
`cdk orphan`.

Two `orphan` variants at different granularities:

- `cdkd orphan <constructPath>...` — synth-driven, **per-resource**.
  Rewrites every sibling reference (Ref / Fn::GetAtt / Fn::Sub /
  dependencies) so the next deploy doesn't re-create the orphan.
- `cdkd state orphan <stack>...` — state-driven, **whole-stack**.
  Removes the entire state record. Works without the CDK app.

Both `cdkd destroy` (synth-driven) and `cdkd state destroy`
(state-driven, no synth) delete AWS resources + state.

## `--remove-protection`: one-shot bypass for protected resources

CDK's `new Stack(app, 'X', { terminationProtection: true })` is honored
by `cdkd destroy` (refused before any per-resource delete). The
state-only path `cdkd state destroy` does NOT honor it — that's the
explicit "I know what I'm doing, ignore CDK guards" escape hatch.

For resource-level protection (`DeletionProtection` etc.), the standard
workflow is edit CDK → redeploy → destroy. `--remove-protection` is the
one-shot bypass:

`cdkd destroy --remove-protection` and `cdkd state destroy
--remove-protection` flip every protection flag off in-place
before each provider's delete API call so the destroy proceeds
without an intermediate edit / redeploy. The flag covers both
stack-level `terminationProtection` (the bypass logs a WARN line
naming the stack) and resource-level protection on the following
types:

| Resource type | Protection field |
| --- | --- |
| `AWS::Logs::LogGroup` | `DeletionProtectionEnabled` |
| `AWS::RDS::DBInstance` | `DeletionProtection` |
| `AWS::RDS::DBCluster` | `DeletionProtection` |
| `AWS::DocDB::DBCluster` | `DeletionProtection` (DocDB DBInstance has no `DeletionProtection` field, so per-instance bypass is a no-op) |
| `AWS::Neptune::DBCluster` | `DeletionProtection` |
| `AWS::Neptune::DBInstance` | `DeletionProtection` |
| `AWS::DynamoDB::Table` | `DeletionProtectionEnabled` |
| `AWS::EC2::Instance` | `DisableApiTermination` |
| `AWS::ElasticLoadBalancingV2::LoadBalancer` | attribute `deletion_protection.enabled` |
| `AWS::Cognito::UserPool` | `DeletionProtection` (`ACTIVE` / `INACTIVE`) |
| `AWS::AutoScaling::AutoScalingGroup` | `DeletionProtection` (`none` / `prevent-force-deletion` / `prevent-all-deletion`) — flag also sets `ForceDelete: true` so AWS terminates running instances as part of the delete |

A single `--remove-protection` covers every type listed above (no
per-type variant). The interactive confirm prompt switches to
`y/N` (requiring an explicit `y` for the destructive bypass);
`--yes` / `-y` / `-f` skips it.

Out of scope: types where AWS doesn't expose a synchronous "flip
protection off" API call (CloudFront Distributions, Lambda function
reserved concurrency, S3 bucket retention, etc.).

## `publish-assets`: synth + build + publish, no deploy

`cdkd publish-assets` runs the asset half of the deploy pipeline
only — synthesize, build Docker images, upload file assets to S3,
push images to ECR — and stops. No state writes, no provisioning.
Typical CI split where one runner builds + uploads assets and a
separate runner deploys.

```bash
cdkd publish-assets                  # all stacks (or auto-detect single stack)
cdkd publish-assets MyStack          # specific stack
cdkd publish-assets -a cdk.out       # skip synth, use pre-synthesized assembly
```

See [docs/cli-reference.md](docs/cli-reference.md#publish-assets-synth--build--publish-no-deploy)
for stack-selection rules and concurrency knobs.

## `local invoke`: run Lambda functions locally

`cdkd local invoke <target>` runs a Lambda function from a CDK app on the
developer's machine, inside a Docker container that bundles the AWS
Lambda Runtime Interface Emulator (RIE). Modeled on `sam local invoke`
but reusing cdkd's synthesis / asset / construct-path plumbing — no
`template.yaml` to maintain, no `cdk synth | sam ...` round-trip.

Requires Docker. v1 supports Node.js and Python runtimes (`nodejs18.x` /
`nodejs20.x` / `nodejs22.x` / `nodejs24.x` / `python3.11` / `python3.12` /
`python3.13` / `python3.14`); other runtimes follow in subsequent PRs.

**Container Lambdas (PR 5 of #224)** — `lambda.DockerImageFunction(...)` /
`Code.ImageUri` is supported alongside ZIP Lambdas. cdkd reads the
function's local `Dockerfile` from `cdk.out` and runs `docker build`
locally before invoking. When no asset matches (typically: invoking a
stack deployed elsewhere), cdkd falls back to `docker pull` from
ECR — same-account / same-region only in v1; cross-account /
cross-region is deferred to a follow-up PR. `Architectures: [x86_64]` /
`[arm64]` are honored via `--platform` so an arm64 host running an
x86_64 Lambda doesn't hit emulation.

```bash
# Invoke by CDK display path (single-stack apps may omit the prefix)
cdkd local invoke MyStack/MyApi/Handler
cdkd local invoke MyStack:MyApiHandler1234ABCD       # logical-id form

# Pass an event payload
cdkd local invoke MyStack/Handler --event events/get.json
echo '{"path":"/"}' | cdkd local invoke MyStack/Handler --event-stdin

# Override env vars (SAM-compatible shape: {"LogicalId":{"KEY":"VALUE"}}
# plus an optional top-level "Parameters" block applied to every invoke)
cdkd local invoke MyStack/Handler --env-vars env.json

# Skip docker pull when iterating
cdkd local invoke MyStack/Handler --no-pull

# Skip the local docker build for container Lambdas (Code.ImageUri).
# Reuses the deterministic cdkd-local-invoke-<hash> tag from a prior
# build. Errors clearly when the tag is missing.
cdkd local invoke MyStack/ContainerHandler --no-build

# Run with the deployed function's narrow execution role (otherwise the
# developer's shell credentials are forwarded — SAM-compatible default)
cdkd local invoke MyStack/Handler --assume-role arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/MyApi-handler-role

# Attach a Node debugger
cdkd local invoke MyStack/Handler --debug-port 9229

# After `cdkd deploy`, recover intrinsic-valued env vars (Ref / Fn::GetAtt
# / Fn::Sub) from cdkd's S3 state instead of dropping them. Off by default
# — keeps the local-only / unscoped flow safe; opt in when you want the
# handler to see the deployed physical IDs (S3 bucket names, DDB table
# names, IAM role ARNs, ...). Disambiguate with `--stack-region <region>`
# when the same stack name has state in multiple regions.
cdkd local invoke MyStack/Handler --from-state
```

**Lambda Layers (PR 6 of #224, issue #232)** — same-stack
`AWS::Lambda::LayerVersion` references in `Properties.Layers` are
resolved automatically and bind-mounted at `/opt` (read-only) inside
the container. Each layer's unzipped asset directory under `cdk.out/`
becomes one `-v <layerAssetPath>:/opt:ro` mount; multiple layers
stack via Docker overlay layering, and AWS's "last layer wins on
file collision" rule is preserved by keeping the template's input
order. Cross-stack / cross-account / cross-region layer ARNs (literal
ARN strings in `Properties.Layers`) are out of scope for v1 — cdkd
hard-errors with a clear pointer at the offending entry. Container
Lambdas (`Code.ImageUri`) silently ignore `Layers` (matches AWS:
container images bake layers at build time).

See [docs/cli-reference.md](docs/cli-reference.md#local-invoke-run-lambda-functions-locally)
for the full surface, target-resolution rules, and v1 scope notes.

## `local start-api`: long-running local API server

`cdkd local start-api` stands up a long-running local HTTP server that
maps the synthesized API Gateway routes (REST v1, HTTP API, Function
URL) to local Lambda invocations against the same RIE-backed Docker
containers `cdkd local invoke` uses. Modeled on `sam local start-api`
but reusing cdkd's synthesis / route-discovery plumbing.

```bash
# Auto-allocate a port (printed at startup) and serve every discovered route
cdkd local start-api

# Pin to port 3000 (SAM-parity / curl muscle memory)
cdkd local start-api --port 3000

# Pre-warm one container per Lambda at server boot — eliminates first-request cold start
cdkd local start-api --warm

# Override env vars per-Lambda (SAM-shape file)
cdkd local start-api --env-vars env.json

# Pin the deployed execution role per Lambda (or globally with a bare ARN)
cdkd local start-api --assume-role MyApiHandler=arn:aws:iam::123:role/handler-role

# Hot reload — re-synth + re-discover routes when cdk.out/ or asset dirs change
cdkd local start-api --watch

# Select a specific API Gateway Stage (default: the first attached)
cdkd local start-api --stage prod
```

Scope: REST v1 + HTTP API + Function URL with AWS_PROXY integrations.
Authorizers (PR 8b — Lambda TOKEN/REQUEST + Cognito User Pool + HTTP v2
JWT), VPC-config Lambda warnings (PR 8b), CORS preflight (PR 8c), hot
reload (PR 8c), and stage variables (PR 8c) are supported. WebSocket
APIs are deferred to a follow-up PR.

**Authorizers (PR 8b)**: `Authorization: Bearer <token>`-protected
routes are gated on the authorizer Lambda's response (TOKEN / REQUEST
authorizers, IAM-policy or HTTP v2 simple shape) or on a JWKS-based JWT
verification (Cognito User Pool authorizers, HTTP v2 JWT authorizers).
When the JWKS endpoint is unreachable from the dev machine, cdkd falls
back to **pass-through mode** (every JWT accepted, with a warn line at
startup) — local-dev-only fallback so a corporate proxy doesn't block
iteration. **Do NOT rely on this in any shared environment.**

**VPC-config Lambdas (PR 8b)**: handlers with `Properties.VpcConfig`
still run locally, but the local container is NOT attached to the
deployed VPC's subnets — calls to private RDS / ElastiCache will fail.
cdkd warns at startup naming each affected Lambda; AWS SDK calls still
reach public AWS endpoints via the dev's network as usual.

**Hot reload (`--watch`)**: re-runs the synth → discover → spec-build
pipeline whenever `cdk.out/` or any of the routed Lambdas' asset
directories change. Routes added / removed / changed swap in
atomically without restarting the HTTP server; in-flight requests
complete against the old container pool while the new pool warms.
Synth failures are non-fatal — the previous version keeps serving and
a warn line names the failure. Off by default; pass `--watch` to
enable.

**CORS preflight**: HTTP API v2 OPTIONS preflight requests are
intercepted when the API has a `CorsConfiguration` block. The server
matches the request's `Origin` / `Access-Control-Request-Method` /
`Access-Control-Request-Headers` against the configured allowlist and
returns a `204 No Content` with the canonical `Access-Control-Allow-*`
headers. Preflight handling is skipped when the user has registered
an explicit OPTIONS method (their Lambda owns it). REST v1 CORS (Mock
OPTIONS method) is not auto-handled and stays out of scope; use the
deployed API for that case.

**Stage variables**: `event.stageVariables` is populated from the
selected Stage's `Variables` (REST v1) / `StageVariables` (HTTP API
v2) map. Default selection is the first Stage attached to each API;
pass `--stage <name>` to pick a Stage by `StageName`. Function URL
routes don't have a Stage — `event.stageVariables` stays `null`.

See [docs/cli-reference.md](docs/cli-reference.md#local-start-api-long-running-local-api-server)
for the full route-discovery rules, container-pool semantics, exit
codes, and per-authorizer-kind detection / response-shape details.

## State Management

State is stored in S3 with optimistic locking via S3 Conditional Writes
(no DynamoDB required). Keys are scoped by `(stackName, region)` so the
same stack deployed to two regions has two independent state files.

| Setting | CLI | cdk.json | Env var | Default |
|---------|-----|----------|---------|---------|
| Bucket | `--state-bucket` | `context.cdkd.stateBucket` | `CDKD_STATE_BUCKET` | `cdkd-state-{accountId}` (legacy `cdkd-state-{accountId}-{region}` is still read with a deprecation warning — run `cdkd state migrate` to consolidate) |
| Prefix | `--state-prefix` | - | - | `cdkd` |

The state bucket is shared across all CDK apps in the same account by
default. To isolate apps, pass different `--state-prefix` values.
`cdkd destroy --all` only targets stacks from the current CDK app
(determined by synthesis), not all stacks in the bucket.

See **[docs/state-management.md](docs/state-management.md)** for the full
spec: S3 key layout, optimistic-locking mechanism (ETag-based), state
schema, legacy `version: 1` migration, bucket-name migration via
`cdkd state migrate`, and troubleshooting.

## Stack Outputs

CDK's `CfnOutput` constructs are resolved and stored in the state file:

```typescript
// In your CDK code
new cdk.CfnOutput(this, 'BucketArn', {
  value: bucket.bucketArn,  // Uses Fn::GetAtt internally
  description: 'ARN of the bucket',
});
```

After deployment, outputs are resolved and saved to the S3 state file:

```json
{
  "outputs": {
    "BucketArn": "arn:aws:s3:::actual-bucket-name-xyz"
  }
}
```

**Key differences from CloudFormation**:

- CloudFormation: Outputs accessible via `aws cloudformation describe-stacks`
- cdkd: Outputs saved in S3 state file (e.g., `s3://bucket/cdkd/MyStack/us-east-1/state.json`)
- Both resolve intrinsic functions (Ref, Fn::GetAtt, etc.) to actual values

## Exit codes

cdkd commands distinguish three outcomes via the process exit code so
CI / bench scripts can react without grepping log output:

| Exit | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| `0` | Success — command completed and no resources are in an error state |
| `1` | Command-level failure — auth error, bad arguments, synth crash, unhandled exception |
| `2` | **Partial failure** — work completed but one or more resources failed (state.json is preserved, re-running typically resolves it) |

Exit `2` is currently emitted by `cdkd destroy` and `cdkd state
destroy` when one or more per-resource deletes fail. The summary line
also switches from `✓ Stack X destroyed` to `⚠ Stack X partially
destroyed (...). State preserved — re-run 'cdkd destroy' / 'cdkd
state destroy' to clean up.` so the visual marker matches the exit
code.
